      <h2> About me </h2>

<p>I am a University of Chicago Booth Finance PhD candidate. My research interests are in empirical corporate finance and public finance, with a focus on financial intermediation, sustainability, and municipal debt markets. 
 <br />
 <br />
 I will be on the job market during winter 2021-2022.</p>

<h2> Research </h2>

<h4> Job market paper </h4>

<p>“Debt and Water: Effects of Bondholder Protections on Public Goods”</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">How do creditors influence the quality of local public goods through municipal debt contracts? I examine this question in the context of municipal water utility debt covenants. As utilities approach their covenant violation thresholds, they increase prices: covenant-constrained utilities raise prices 9% relative to unconstrained utilities following a drought shock to water demand. But, utilities also reduce hiring growth and reduce manager pay as they approach thresholds. I also find that officials sequence their budget decisions according to a hierarchy: they raise revenues as much as possible, then cut spending. The incidence of cuts is first on water system expenses and then on administrative expenses. System problems and pipe breaks are most sensitive to distance to covenant thresholds for the most constrained utilities.</p>

<h4> Working papers </h4>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LnkNR7sFN3_BsVis5GPTEgzUjH4LuQc0/view">“The Risk and Return of Impact Investing Funds”</a>
<br />

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We provide the first analysis of the risk exposure and consequent risk-adjusted performance of impact investing funds, private market funds with dual financial and social goals. We introduce a new dataset of impact fund cash flows constructed directly from financial statements. When accounting for market risk exposure, impact funds underperform the market, but outperform venture capital (VC) funds, consistent with the presence of frictions in private markets. Impact funds perform on par with funds matched on size, asset class, and vintage years. We exploit known distortions in measures of VC performance to characterize the risk profile of impact funds. Impact funds have substantially lower market beta than VC funds, contradicting the idea of sustainability as a "luxury good." Adding factors does not change the estimate of performance.</p>

<h4> Publications </h4>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378426618300864">“The Anatomy of Financial Vulnerabilities and Banking Crises”</a> 
<br />

<br />


<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">We extend the framework of Aikman et al. (2017) that maps vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system to a broader set of financial vulnerabilities in 27 advanced and emerging economies. We capture a holistic view of the evolution of financial vulnerabilities before and after a banking crisis. We find that, before a banking crisis, pressures in asset valuations materialize first and then a build-up of imbalances in the external, financial, and nonfinancial sectors occurs. After a crisis, these vulnerabilities subside, but sovereign debt imbalances rise as governments try to mitigate the consequences of the crisis. Our main indexes, which aggregate these vulnerabilities, predicts banking crises better than the credit-to-GDP gap (CGG) or sector-specific vulnerability indexes, especially at long horizons. Our aggregate indexes also explain the variation in the severity of banking crises and the duration of recessions relatively well, as it incorporates possible spillover and amplification channels of financial vulnerabilities from one sector to another. Therefore, our framework is useful for macroprudential policy making and crisis management.</p>
